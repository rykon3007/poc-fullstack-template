Next.js is hosted as a frontend on Azure Container Instances (ACI), using API Routes to access a SQLite database from the backend. In the cloud, storage is persisted with Azure File Share for secure, cost-effective access. GitHub is used for source code management, and an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment process.
